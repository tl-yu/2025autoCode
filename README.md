# Here is the simulation code of paper "Robust Optimal Control of Discrete-time Markov Chains with Unknown Transition Probabilities" by Yu.
## case1_once.m to case4_once.m and case5_main.m is the simulation result of running five cases once.
## duibi1.m to duibi5.m are the cumulative performance index simulation results of the five cases after 200 runs.
The other files are auxiliary functions and plotting functions.
